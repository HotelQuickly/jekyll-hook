I just created a new iOS build with these issues fixed. Download it [on HockeyApp](https://rink.hockeyapp.net/download/6be6d0f6cf3f40368242cfdbb3e870e1) and check it out:

 * improved UX of choosing multinight screen
 * improved hotel gallery (backed with bright new image generation system implemented by Michal)
 * implemented 3 step booking process (overview, guest info, verification)
 * finished implementation of paypal payments (Paypal account and paypal credit cards)
 * fixed layout issues on hotel list, hotel detail
 * solved various UX issues and bugs
 
Happy testing! :)
