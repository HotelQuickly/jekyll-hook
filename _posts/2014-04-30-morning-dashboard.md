title:  New morning dashboard

Since we have now more than 40 projects connected into one environment, one of the pain areas was not a good overview of individual components - are they working? Are they fast enough?

We also had issues over the weekends (especially Saturday morning, right, Martina?) and needed to have a full overview of all systems. That's why it's called **Morning Dashboard** :-) We adjusted the Geckoboard:

* created a very high-level dashboard for the public on [status.hotelquickly.com](http://status.hotelquickly.com)
* dropped the old inventory dashboard (due to performance reasons)
* and very detailed for DevOps on [this hidden URL](https://hotelquickly.geckoboard.com/dashboards/076C3B7FD353A1CB)

Now we can quickly see if there are issues with
* performance of servers or databases
* inventory from different sources
* room BAR aggregation
* offer reloading (queue)
* API speed
* failed bookings
* and lots of other stuff

Feel free to bookmark the URL and check when you are on call centre duty :-)
