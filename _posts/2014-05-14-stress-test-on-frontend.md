As a part of the preparation for for Line's Hot Deal campaign, we're testing scalability of our servers. Blitz is a great tool that can do the hard work and we tried it on Frontend server.

Sadly, the server wasn't able to handle 120+ people, crashed after 10 seconds and was unavailable for a while :-o For the Line deal we'll need to scale it much better.
