We're currently working on these areas:

* Backend
  * Support issues (currently 30+ in the pipeline as Byte was working on PayPal payments last week)
  * Current important issues, i.e.:
     * New reports to prevent voucher abuse
     * Speed-up XML load for a small segment of hotels that are likely to be booked
     * Prepare strings for translations
* iOS
  * Prepare a new build for 2nd round of UX testing (planned on Monday May 12)
* Android
  * Copy some of the new things from iOS
