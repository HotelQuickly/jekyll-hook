title: Improved fetching prices from XML sources

Together with Byte, we have improved fetching availability from Vanilla and Expedia.

Until now, the fetching was done once in 2 hours. It was just too many hotels, to do it more often.

Now, the hotels that are currently showing in the app are updated **every 30 minutes**. All other hotels are updated every 2 hours.

This should solve quite often seen failed bookings due not updated price / availability.
