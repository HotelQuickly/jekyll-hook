As a part of the preparation for for Line's Hot Deal campaign, we're testing scalability of our servers. Blitz is a great tool that can do the hard work and we tried it on Frontend server.

Sadly, the server wasn't able to handle 120+ people and crashed after 10 seconds :-o For Line we'll need to scale it much more.
