So the database upgrade (from MySQL 5.5 to 5.6) was not as smooth as expected. We postponed it by half a year, but tonight upgraded (Jim until 4am).

**6:15am**
 
Shortly after 6am i noticed the offers are not generated and investigated the issue. Problem was that instead of 3 seconds per hotel it took 250 seconds to generate one offer.
 
**8:10am**
 
Nothing helped to fix it until 8:10am BKK, so then at 8:11am created a backup and truncated the offer table (5mil rows).
At 8:24am the first offers were generated (faster than 2 sec each) and within 6 minutes all hotels were generated.
 
**8:30am**
 
Now we're checking the rest of the system and will be migrating the old offers from backup later today.
