The first public version of HotelQuickly was launched at the beginning of April 2013. I remember those hectic days very well as we were working 18 hours a day on average. There was so much to do and there were only two of us (Josef and me) actively developing the backend, hotel extranet, iOS and Android applications. Full of excitement, stress and other positive emotions, we supported each other with thumbs-up's and likes on Skype.

Lots of changed since then:

* the IT team more then trippled
* we dropped Android app and created a new one from scratch
* developed application for BlackBerry 10
* we significantly improved the backend and extranet
* completed thousands of tasks in Asana
* wrote zillions lines of code

**But we're still working on our vision &ndash; to build the best mobile solution for spontaneous hotel bookings.** Keep us fingers crossed! :-)
