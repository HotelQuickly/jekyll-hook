title: New iOS developer working remotely

Since Jirawat (a.k.a. Kim) is working less and less for us and in a few weeks will stop completely, we hired a remote iOS developer helping with the upcoming iOS release.

He's name is Edward and he's pretty senior. Those 120+ tasks should be a piece of (chocolate) cake for him! :-)
