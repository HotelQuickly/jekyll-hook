As a response for fighting against fraud (ah, those Chinese guys) we will be always charging 1 USD (even if the room is for free). We hope it will help us to identify the fake users much easier (how many cards they can have? One, two?).

And the best part is that we still can say the room is for free - we just do not settle payments with amount lower than 1 USD, we only authorize the payment.
