With Jim we kicked-off the preparations for Line Hot Deal campaign. There are a few challenges we'll need to handle:

* to be able to handle thousands of concurrent connections within 10 minutes
* to be able to process hundreds of payments within 10 minutes
* to have payments backed-up (so we'll use both PayPal and Braintree)

This seems to be a lovely project!
